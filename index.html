        <h2>HaYoung - Student Body President</h2>
        <p><img class='headshot' src='headshots/Angel Mancera.jpeg'>Hi! I’m Hayoung, and I’ve been on ESC for two years now, during which I worked on pass/fail(PDF) and COVID policies. And as your VP of Comms, I’ve created a greater social media presence to transmit information from the council to you, but also from you to the administration, such as addressing dining hall crowding by helping open new ones. I cannot wait once again to bring you FREE merch and metrocards, host the SEAS Cruise and ExploreNYC. Next year, I hope to voice your opinions proudly and work for solutions to make the SEAS experience unforgettable! </p>

In my past two years on ESC, I've had the sensational pleasures of helping pass emergency P/D/F, organizing the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 SEAS galas, lobbying for expanded Dodge Fitness Center hours, and creating the annual free merch giveaway. Now, I'm running for VP of Comms to make sure that you’ll continue to be heard and uplifted by ESC! </p>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <h2>What We've Done:</h2>
        <p>We’re the TrustSEAS, a party made up of five dedicated ESC members who have been essential to this past year’s SEAS Cruise, Fall Formal, 
            ExploreNYC, and FREE Merch drops alongside P/D/F policy, mental health initiatives, 
            and expanding dining options! </p>
        <h2>What We'll Do:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>P/D/F:</b> We’ll fight to expand P/D/F to include a more diverse range of courses—both technical AND non-technical—so you can expand your intellectual horizons, free of GPA concerns!
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>MetroCard Initiative:</b> In addition to free metrocards for FLI students, we are working towards a collaboration with the MTA to get FREE transport for all undergrads.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>DEI:</b> Uplift affinity groups and program leaders to improve cross-organization collaboration and support. Collaborate with Reproductive Health Justice Collaborative to increase access to abortion medication/essential healthcare on campus! 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dining:</b> We envision 24-hour JJ’s, dining halls with open seats, and food options that accommodate students of all dietary needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Housing:</b> We’ll advocate for flexible summer housing, thorough sanitation, and air conditioning in every residence hall.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Health:</b> Improve accessibility of physical and mental health resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Events:</b> Beyond our existing traditions, we’ll bring more free food, cultural fairs, and host a SEAS formal in one of NYC’s beautiful museums! 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Thank you, and we're so excited for us to thrive together.</p>
