        <h2>HaYoung - Student Body President</h2>
        <p><img class='headshot' src='headshots/Angel Mancera.jpeg'>Hi! I’m Hayoung, and I’ve been on ESC for two years now, during which I worked on pass/fail(PDF) and COVID policies. And as your VP of Comms, I’ve created a greater social media presence to transmit information from the council to you, but also from you to the administration, such as addressing dining hall crowding by helping open new ones. I cannot wait once again to bring you FREE merch and metrocards, host the SEAS Cruise and ExploreNYC. Next year, I hope to voice your opinions proudly and work for solutions to make the SEAS experience unforgettable! </p>

In my past two years on ESC, I've had the sensational pleasures of helping pass emergency P/D/F, organizing the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 SEAS galas, lobbying for expanded Dodge Fitness Center hours, and creating the annual free merch giveaway. Now, I'm running for VP of Comms to make sure that you’ll continue to be heard and uplifted by ESC! </p>

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <h2>What we've done:</h2>
        <p>We’re Back in SEASon, a party composed of incumbent ESC members.
          In the past, we have collaborated with student organizations and faculty to approve key policies for our constituents and hold events to boost our campus spirit!
          Some of our favorite ones were: creating SEAS Gala, initiating Explore NYC, organizing Meet a Fellow Engineer, and passing … the Fall 2021 P/D/F!</p>


        <h2>What we'll do:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Policies:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>P/D/F: Advocacy for a PERMANENT P/D/F policy, allowing SEAS students two floating P/D/Fs to be used on any course in any semester.</li>
                <li>Student Metrocard Initiative: SEAS students will have access to NYC by means of free MetroCards provided by ESC. </li>

        </ol>
