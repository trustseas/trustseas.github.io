        <h2>Gabe - Vice President of Student Life</h2>
        <p><img class='headshot' src='headshots/Gabe Guo.jpg'>Hi! I'm the real Gabe Guo, and I'm a sophomore from Buffalo majoring in CS. I love MCU movies (especially Iron Man), fried chicken, unicorns, and sunsets. In the past year as Health & Wellness Representative, I've had the great pleasure of helping pass emergency P/D/F, expanding accessibility of dining options, and spearheading the t-shirt design challenge and giveaway. I'm running for VP of Student Life because I believe that every single member of our SEAS family should optimize both their academic performance and fun times at Columbia! </p>

        <h2>Chloe - Vice President of Finance</h2>
        <p><img class='headshot' src='headshots/Chloe Harrah.JPG'>Hi! My name is Chloe Harrah and I'm a first-year student from Santa Barbara, CA planning to major in Computer Science. This past year, I served on Engineering Student Council as one of the Student Representatives for the Class of 2025. In addition, I was one of the members of the Student Life Committee in which I assisted in organizing the SEAS Gala event and Explore NYC Initiative. Through these experiences, I have gained a community of friends and a wealth of valuable information through my service, and hope to continue representing SEAS as VP of Finance. Outside of ESC, I am a member of club tennis and love getting coffee and exploring the city! If elected, I hope to continue to work with my peers on policies and other vital initiatives, such as DEI, to improve the Columbia experience and further strengthen our community.</p>

Throughout my years at Columbia, I've had the opportunity and enjoyment of participating in the Engineering Student Council and spearheading initiatives that have led us through challenging times and brought the community closer together. As a VP of Policy, I've led a magnificent team that brought us the PDF option in previous semesters and is currently working to make it possible for this and future semesters.

        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <h2>What we've done:</h2>
        <p>We’re Back in SEASon, a party composed of incumbent ESC members.
          In the past, we have collaborated with student organizations and faculty to approve key policies for our constituents and hold events to boost our campus spirit!
          Some of our favorite ones were: creating SEAS Gala, initiating Explore NYC, organizing Meet a Fellow Engineer, and passing … the Fall 2021 P/D/F!</p>


        <h2>What we'll do:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Policies:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>P/D/F: Advocacy for a PERMANENT P/D/F policy, allowing SEAS students two floating P/D/Fs to be used on any course in any semester.</li>
                <li>Student Metrocard Initiative: SEAS students will have access to NYC by means of free MetroCards provided by ESC. </li>
                <li>Transfer Inclusion Initiative: Organization of a special NSOP, exclusive acceptance packages, and a transfer-specific days on campus.</li>
                <li>Mental/General Health Initiatives: Communication with administrators to improve mental health services and accessibility.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Events you will actually go to:</b> Rooftop formal (Bridgerton-style ball), SEAS Gala Cruise - 2023 Edition, Explore NYC Initiative 2.0, puppy day, cultural fairs, and lots and lots of free food!</li>
            <li><b>DEI:</b> We are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion with forward-thinking policies like an FGLI fundraising initiative, mentorship programs, support for minority and cultural organizations.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Thank you, and we're so excited for us to thrive together.</p>
